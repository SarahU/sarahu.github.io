			<i>Data Engineer Interview Service - Feb 2023</i> <br>
			<div>
				Sarah interviewed a potential data engineer candidate for us. Before approaching the assessment, she first established an understanding of the needs of the business. This included the expectations of the role, the data management needs of business, and the nuances of the current team make-up. <br>
				We required the candidate to display an ability to lead the data engineering efforts in the organisation in order to further bridge technical teams, AI and business. This was a critical hire for the team and Sarah made us feel confident in her ability to assess the candidate right from the get-go. <br>
				Sarah prepared a well-thought-out architecture technical interview over a 90-minute session. In this session, she explored the candidates ability to reason, and holistically think about data. She further assessed the technical understanding of the tools and the appropriate use thereof as part of a pragmatic scenario-based discussion. <br>
				Within a few days, we received a comprehensive report that detailed the shortcomings and strengths of the candidate with a firm conclusion on where the candidate's experience lies. This report allowed us to make the decision easily. It also provided constructive feedback that we shared directly with the candidate. The candidate even praised the level of transparency and openness, and said they would use it going forward to improve in their career. <br>
				Sarah conducted herself in a professional manner, both in communication and execution. She made us feel confident in our ability to assess the candidate and ran an exceptionally efficient technical interview with the candidate. We plan to continue to use her services in future even beyond hiring candidates. <br>
