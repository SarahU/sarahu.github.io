				The difference between my coaching and mentorship is, mentorship is driven by the mentee. I do not follow up and we might
				not have regular sessions. For coaching, I prepare for the sessions, follow up with you, send reminders where required and will do work
				on your behalf such as creating a CV, searching for jobs, reviewing applications, reviewing code in projects, etc.

			Feb 2024

				After almost 8 months of coaching with Sarah, my attitude about myself,
				and my career has shifted 180 degrees.
				I found the courage to make and even embrace change and to move forward by making choices
				that benefit me, not just looking out for everyone else.
				I want to emphasize that Sarah has helped me develop ways to deal with situations using my
				own knowledge and self-awareness, and she developed a plan,
				a concept for what I want my career to look life for the next years of my life. <br>
