It's no secret that interviews for software engineers and other
technical roles still leave a lot to be desired, to this day.
Reliance on Leet-code style interviews and arbitrary examples is still
prevalent despite being known to be poor techniques in gauging someone's
actual capability and experience.
But even these techniques can be trained for.

What is less easy to overcome, is poor technique from interviewERS.

In all my years working (14), I've only received
interview training once, and it was very light - more about the process
than actual skills in how to conduct good interviews well, as the facilitator.

It's a shame because poor interviewing skills leads to a poor candidate experience,
inadequate assessment of skills and time waste.

It's true that it is easy to evaluate someone's skills in a short amount of time,
and much of the skill needed to evaluate another's skills will come from practice,
but there are things to be aware of that will help you make the most
of the time.
Be warned, they may require some self-reflection!

## Problem 1
### Your questions/scenario is too arbitrary.
#### Unclear boundaries and context
Coding suffers less from this because the scope is small enough, but
system design interviews that are too arbitrary generally lead to poorer outcomes:
The context is too limited.
While the interview usually starts with little context, allowing the interviewee
space to ask questions and the interviewer to evaluate how the 
interviewee goes about doing this, if the interview is not well thought out enough, 
answers to questions become challenging to provide and the constraints become
confusing and unclear.

Interviewee: "Is this D3 bucket under our control or not"
Interviewer: "I don't know, it doesn't matter"
Interviewee: "So can we make changes to this or not?" *confused*

Interviewee: "Where does this data get used"
Interviewer: "It could be used anywhere"
Interviewee: "Is there a first a destination in mind, we woudln't store data that doesn't have a purpose surely".
Interviewer: "We haven't established that yet".
Interviewee: "Ok, so the purpose could be investigative at least"
Interviewer: "We can assume that"
Interviewee: (do you not work here?)

If there are no boundaries to find, how can we start creating solutions?
In times like these, I have found the interviewer to be looking
for a solution to be copied and pasted out, much in the same way
one needs to regurgitate an algorithm, which leaves the interviewer 
in an awkward position - one where they now need to guess an answer
and another in which they wonder if the interviewer has done this exercise
themselves and thought about it for longer than 5 minutes.
An experienced engineer will know there are constraints and
boundaries to the system so have some.

#### Unrealistic scenario
Choose a realistic scenario that you have covered before. Even better
if it's one at the company you're working at, so that the candidate
can get a feel for the business at the same time.

## Problem 2
### You are not present.
While I have seen folks on their cellphones during interviews, 
which is blatantly disrespectful, I want to cover the more subtle
behaviour which plagues remote interviews more than in-person ones.
And that is simply that you are unfocused and  not present in the interview.

This does not come through from a lack of eye contact, but more 
in the form of requiring the candidate to repeat themselves because
the interviewer was not listening, reading Slack or something else, which
is clear from your behaviour in the video call.

Sometimes this is more emulated from the person who is not leading the interview
but this is a case to be aware of. An interviewer who is not paying attention, 
makes the candidate feel like the interviewer would rather be elsewhere and
that they are wasting each others time. It could cause the candidate to disengage
in the interview and hence perform worse.
If you are there to review, then you should make that known, and not actively
participate. Even switch your camera off.

### You're looking for a particular solution
Sometimes interviewers look out for specific scenarios and miss


## Problem 3
### Poor facilitation skills
Many interviewers don't understand that it is their job to drive the
interview in order to cover all the areas they want the candidate
to demonstrate. While the candidate, experience dependent, should drive
the solution, the scenario is controlled by the interviewer.
It is not the candidate who decides that: there are more users, there
is more data, an error has occurred or that certain solutions/tools
are not available for use in the scenario.

I've participated in interviews were the candidate has been left to languish
without direction, trying to guess what the interviewer is looking for.
I've also been in interviews when it was clear that the candidate lacked 
sufficient experience at the time but were left to play out the time 
because the interviewer did not feel they were able to end the session.
Whether it is from lack of confidence or experience, being an 
interviewer is not an observational role where you ask a few questions.
It's a role where your job is to understand the breadth of the 
candidates capability and experience.

In times of confusion or misunderstanding (which is very normal), 
I've seen interviewers struggle to get the candidate back on track.
I've not sure if it's because they don't want to "give something away"
or don't want to "steer the conversation", 

## Problem 4
### Lack of interview review
A simple area where many interviews fail - they've never been taken
by a member of the team.
A review would allow you to pick up areas where the domain in unclear,
where you've missed a boundary and where instructions could
cause confusion.


## Where to improve
1. Clarity, structure and a realistic, well-rounded scenario
will go a long way to creating a clear interview and 
good experience for both candidate and interviewer.
2. Be attentive - **either be in the session, or don't**. It's a not the time
to catch up on Slack.
3. Practice being a clear facilitator.
If you're running a system design interview, move through
different layers on complexity clearly. Be direct if a candidate is going off track,
say the same thing in different ways to improve understanding and say something
if you don't understand what the candidate is trying to convey.
You are there to get the best out of them, not trick them or leave them flayling.
If you realise the candidate cannot meet the level, make a note of why and
end the interview.
4. Practice your interview among your colleaugues. If they don't enjoy it
or find issues with it, neither will candidates enjoy it and it'll
be a worse experience for everyone. Interviews cost a lot of time. Don't waste it!

Bonus tip: Have empathy for bad interview experiences.
Many folks have been treated poorly at other interviews. 
They may have been taught poor interviewing habits which is 
hindering their understanding and clarity of thought. 

Why bother

Poor interview lead to poor candidate experiences and inadequate 
evaluation of skills. You might lose out on candidates which would
excel in the role, because you couldn't assess their skills, or, even worse
because you left a bad impression.


-> Your question is not well thought through
-> not realistic
-> not large or well scoped enough
-> not staggered
-> you're looking for an answer
-> You are not present
-> distracted
-> you are being interviewed too
-> Poor facilitation
-> not staggered
-> poor technique
-> can;t get the interview back on track

-> clarity, bravery (no but ... confidence?)

-> you're looking for your solution

-> you haven't reviewed your interview

In Summary
Remember that you are being interviewed at the same time that you
are interviewing the candidate. Facilitate clearly and bring the 
best out of the candidate with a clear scenario, constraints
