Why your interviews suck and what you can do about it


-> Your question is not well thought through
    -> not realistic
    -> not large or well scoped enough
    -> not staggered
    -> you're looking for an answer
-> You are not present
    -> distracted
    -> you are being interviewed too
-> Poor facilitation
    -> not staggered
    -> poor technique
    -> can;t get the interview back on track

-> clarity, bravery (no but ... confidence?)

-> you're looking for your solution

-> you haven't reviewed your interview
